sudoku for cs121

Known problems:
  * The "New Game" and "Reset Board" buttons don't give any feedback when
    clicked.
  * The "Congratulations!" that appears when a board is finished doesn't go
    away if digits are removed from the board. Either it should go away or the
    board, once completed, should become wholly immutable.
  * The app dies without any helpful message if it runs out of grids. This
    isn't really a problem because we have 30,000 grids to choose from, but
    ideally something should be done about it.
